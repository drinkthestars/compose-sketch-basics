## ‚ú® Sketchy + Creative Coding with Compose '23

![build](https://github.com/drinkthestars/sketchy/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to the Sketchy - a playground for creative coding using Jetpack Compose! This branch specifically serves as an extended resource for the "Creative Coding with Compose" talk from Droidcon SF '23.

### üìñ About the Code
The code samples featured in the talk can be found [here](https://github.com/drinkthestars/sketchy/tree/main/app/src/main/kotlin/com/goofy/goober/sketchy/screens/slides). Feel free to explore, experiment, and modify these samples as you dive deeper into the exciting world of creative coding!

Here are a few examples of what you might find in there:

Polygons! | Texture Shaders! | Splatter!

### üìö Resources
The talk and the samples in this repository were greatly influenced and inspired by several resources dedicated to creative coding. Here are a few recommendations to extend your learning:

- [Genuary](https://genuary.art/): An annual generative art event, with new prompts every day of January to inspire and challenge you.
- The Coding Train: A YouTube channel by Daniel Shiffman that offers creative coding tutorials that are fun, informative, and engaging. [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).
- Form+Code by Casey Reas and Chandler McWilliams: This book explores the possibilities of software within the realm of design and art. It's a great resource to understand the concepts and theory behind creative coding. [Get the book here](https://www.amazon.com/Form-Code-Design-Architecture-Briefs/dp/1568989377).
- T[he Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe is an essential guide to understanding and writing shaders.
- [Matt DesLauriers's Creative Coding Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/canvas-webgl/) is a fantastic place to learn creative coding with JavaScript, Canvas and WebGL.
- [Generative Art by Inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/generative/) provides a great introduction to generative algorithms and their application in creative coding.
- Explore the works of [Vera Molnar](https://www.dam-gallery.de/artist/Vera_Molnar), one of the pioneers of computer and algorithmic arts.
- Delve into the abstract and geometric paintings of [Hilma af Klint](https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/hilma-af-klint), a visionary artist who created compositions that often resemble outputs of generative algorithms.
- Discover [Sol LeWitt](https://www.moma.org/artists/3542), known for his work in conceptual art and minimalism, often using systems and seriality that resonate with the logic of creative coding. Also, check out [Solving Sol](https://www.solvingsol.com/), an open challenge to implement Sol's instructional art pieces in any language or medium.

‚ú® Happy coding!
